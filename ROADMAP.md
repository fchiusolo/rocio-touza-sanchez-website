## Action Items

### 1. Photo Session
Define shots needed:
- Hero portrait (warm, approachable)
- Square crop for social profiles
- Optional: lifestyle/workspace shots

### 2. Feedback Session with Rocío
Topics to discuss:
- Copywriting tone and key messages
- Color preferences (what colors feel right?)
- Booking flow preference (how does she want clients to reach her?)

### 3. Google Analytics
Can be integrated now - no dependencies, quick win.
