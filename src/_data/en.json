      "I'm Rocío, a general health psychologist, dedicated with deep commitment and motivation to my psychotherapeutic work for over ten years. I firmly believe that continuous training is a fundamental pillar of my practice.",
      "I accompany people seeking a space where they can talk about what's happening to them, understand it, and find new ways of being. My work is based on attentive listening and caring for each person's subjectivity.",
      "I understand that distress doesn't arise in isolation, but is constructed in relation to our history, our relationships, and the social and cultural contexts that shape us. Therefore, my practice integrates an analytical perspective with great sensitivity to diversity, relationships, and social aspects.",
      "In session, I offer a safe space where you can express, explore, and process what may be affecting you, without judgment and at your own pace. A place where you can think (about yourself), put into words what's hard to name, and work through what causes distress.",
      "I look forward to meeting you!"

      },
      {
        "question": "What do I need for online sessions?",
        "answer": "A quiet, private place where you feel comfortable, stable internet connection, and a device (computer, tablet, or phone) with camera and microphone."

        "answer": "Yes, as long as you notify me at least 24 hours in advance. Cancellations with less than 24 hours notice must be paid."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is online therapy as effective as in-person?",
        "answer": "Yes. Numerous studies show that online therapy is as effective as in-person therapy. The most important factors are the therapeutic connection and your commitment to the process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer in-person therapy?",
        "answer": "Yes, although online therapy is my primary modality, I also offer in-person sessions in Barcelona (Sagrada Familia area) with limited availability. If you're interested in this option, contact me to check available slots."

      },
      {
        "question": "Do you prescribe medication?",
        "answer": "No. As a psychologist, I don't prescribe medication. If I consider it might be beneficial, I can recommend consulting with a psychiatrist who works collaboratively with therapy."

      {
        "question": "Do you work with health insurance?",
        "answer": "I currently don't work with insurance companies, but I collaborate with centers that do. If you're interested in this option, you can contact me privately for more information."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens in the first session?",
        "answer": "I know it's not always easy to decide to start therapy. In the first session, you'll have space to share what brings you to consultation. I'm also interested in understanding the journey that led you to this moment. I'll listen to you attentively, without judgment or rush, and you can ask me whatever you need about how I work. That first meeting will allow us to see if my way of working fits with what you're looking for."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if you're the right therapist for me?",
        "answer": "The therapeutic connection is a fundamental aspect of psychological work. Each person has different needs and not everyone feels comfortable with the same approaches or theoretical frameworks. That's why the first sessions will be fundamental in this sense, as they will allow us to explore your needs and how I work. If you feel it's not the right fit for you, I'll understand and can guide you toward other options that better suit what you're looking for. My goal is for you to find a safe and meaningful space for your process."

        "question": "Do you offer therapy in other languages?",
